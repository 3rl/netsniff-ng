Some information about potential netsniff-ng hackers can be found here!
First of all, you might want to clone our git repository before you start
hacking on anything:

 $ git clone git://repo.or.cz/netsniff-ng.git

The best way to propose your ideas is to outline them in a short mail to
workgroup@netsniff-ng.org or to our public mailing list address
netsniff-ng@googlegroups.com. We are looking forward for your proposals!
Of course, keep in mind that you can mail smaller portions of code like
bug fixes immediately.

The best way to make a contribution to netsniff-ng is to send us your 
code in the form of a unified diff against the latest released or
development version and, preferably, the branch from our Git repository.
Your patch should then be sent to workgroup@netsniff-ng.org or 
bugs@netsniff-ng.org.

Before submitting your patch make sure to indent your code appropriate.
For this, have a look at our coding conventions within the CODING file.

Well, I guess most has been said ... so happy packet hacking! We're looking
forward for your patches, ideas and improvements!
