Version 0.5.1 (08.08.2009)
==========================
* Initial, unofficial release

Version 0.5.2 (06.09.2009)
==========================
* Initial, official release
* Fixed some race condition in netsniff-ng.c

Version 0.5.3 (06.12.2009)
==========================
* Added Makefile
* Added Manpage
* Documentation
* (Debian packaging)
* Some less code refractorings in netsniff-ng.c and 
  check_packets.c

Version 0.5.3.1 (16.12.2009)
============================
* check_packets.c has been put into src/clients/ due 
  to not officially supporting it anymore. It is just 
  a simple unix domain socket client example for netsniff-ng,
  but nothing more.

Version 0.5.4.0 (???)
============================
* Added high-resolution timer
* Fixed some small bugs / mem-leaks
* Some code refactorings
* Added SIGHUP ignorance, so for instance netsniff-ng keeps 
  alive on ssh-sessions
* Added pid output during start
* Better packet visualization on -C mode
* Locking of RX_RING due to make it non-swappable
* futex locking of critical paths instead of mutex
* Added setpriority() for notifying the scheduler to make use 
  of the full timeslice
* Setting process affinity to specific CPU on demand (via Param)
  This can be useful for a patched init proc, so that on demand
  netsniff-ng can be the only process for a single CPU
* -C option can now be switched on and off during runtime via SIGUSR2
