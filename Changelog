Version 0.5.3.1 (16.12.2009)

============================
* Added high-resolution timer

* Added SIGHUP ignorance, so for instance netsniff-ng keeps 
  alive on ssh-sessions
* Added pid output during start

* Scheduler tweaks
* Setting process affinity to specific CPU on demand (via Param)
  This can be useful for a patched init proc, so that on demand
  netsniff-ng can be the only process for a single CPU
* -s option can now be switched on and off during runtime via SIGUSR2
* Option for running netsniff-ng in non-blocking mode
