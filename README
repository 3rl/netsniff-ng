About
=====

netsniff-ng is a high performance Linux network sniffer 
for packet inspection. It can be used for protocol analysis 
and reverse engineering, network debugging, measurement of 
performance throughput or network statistics creation of 
incoming packets.

It works similar to tcpdump, but a 'zero-copy' mechanism 
for network packets results in better performance than 
libpcap-based sniffers.

For more information about netsniff-ng have a look at the 
manpage.

Requirements (for your own kernels)
===================================

Your kernel should have been built with CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP=y 
in order to use netsniff-ng. This is default on your 
preinstalled Debian kernel. We recommend >= 2.6.26.
