netsniff-ng is is a free, performant Linux network analyzer and networking
toolkit [1].

The gain of performance is reached by 'zero-copy' mechanisms, so that the
kernel does not need to copy packets from kernelspace to userspace and vice
versa.

For this purpose netsniff-ng is libpcap independent, but nevertheless supports
the pcap file format for capturing, replaying and performing offline-analysis
of pcap dumps. Furthermore we are focussing on building a robust, clean and
secure analyzer and utilities that complete netsniff-ng as a support for
penetration testing.

netsniff-ng can be used for protocol analysis, reverse engineering and network
debugging and currently consists of the following tools:

  * netsniff-ng: the 'zero-copy' sniffer itself
  * trafgen: a powerful 'zero-copy' network packet generator
  * ifpps: a top-like kernel networking statistics tool
  * arphunt: an ARP cache poisoning utility

For any questions or feedback about netsniff-ng you are welcome to leave us a
message to <workgroup@netsniff-ng.org>. This project is purely non-commercial
and will always stay that way! netsniff-ng is developed by Daniel Borkmann and
Emmanuel Roullit.

Also, have a look at our FAQ [2] for answering your questions. Furthermore,
we have a development blog [3] where we sometimes drop some interesting things
or news for the outside world! A public repository of the old stable releases
(which you probably do not want to have a look at), can be found here [4]. A 
probably not so much up-to-date benchmark is available to the public [5], too.

Sometimes we also hang out in IRC at #netsniff-ng on freenode.org. A mailing
list for netsniff-ng moderated (spam free) user discussions is open to the
public, too. Subscribe and mail to <netsniff-ng@googlegroups.com>.

You might want to have a look at NOTE, INSTALL, REPORTING-BUGS, HACKING,
CODING and COPYING, too. Good lord, so much to read! Anyways, enough talking
from my side and happy packet hacking!
