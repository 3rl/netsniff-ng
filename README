About
=====

netsniff-ng is a high performance Linux network sniffer for packet 
inspection. 

It can be used for protocol analysis and reverse engineering, network 
debugging, measurement of performance throughput or network statistics 
creation of incoming packets.

It works similar to tcpdump, but a 'zero-copy' mechanism for network packets 
results in better performance than libpcap-based sniffers.

For more information about netsniff-ng have a look at the manpage and 
the manual.

Requirements (for your own kernels)
===================================

Your kernel should have been built with CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP=y in order to use 
netsniff-ng. This is default on your preinstalled Debian kernel. We 
recommend >= 2.6.26.
