About
=====

netsniff-ng is a high performance linux network sniffer for packet 
inspection. Basically, it is similar to tcpdump, but it doesn't 
need one syscall per packet. Instead, it uses an memory mapped area 
within kernelspace for accessing packets without copying them to 
userspace (zero-copy mechanism).

This tool is useful for debugging your network, measuring performance 
throughput or creating network statistics of incoming packets on 
central network nodes like routers or firewalls.

By providing an unix domain socket client, you're able to export 
collected data during runtime (e.g. for Nagios). 

Some Features
=============

 * No usage of libpcap
 * High performance
  o Zero-Copy mode via memory mapped kernel RX_RING (no syscalls for 
    packet-fetching as in libpcap)
  o No extra callback function for each packet (as in libpcap)
  o Short critical path 
 * Runs in userspace
 * Promiscuous Mode support
 * Berkeley Packet Filter support
 * Unix Domain Socket server for data fetching during sniff
 * Predefined filters for some protocols, e.g. possible Skype (UDP probe) 
   prefiltering (or write your own ones for accessing each byte of the frame)
 * VLAN based sniffing possible
 * Run it in foreground (e.g. be verbose and print packets) or as a sys daemon
 * Support for integration of fetched statistics into Nagios 
   (check_packets plugin) 

Requirements (for your own kernels)
===================================

Your kernel should have been built with CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP=y in order 
to use netsniff-ng. This is default on your preinstalled Debian kernel.
