You might want to have NAPI drivers [1] enabled in your kernel to
reduce interrupt load and for high-speed (= relative to the cpu 
speed) PCAP dumping and replay, a fast SSD isn't too bad either.
Next to this, (and this refers to packet generation as well), a 
10-Gbit/s-Ethernet NIC, an appropriate amount of RAM and a fast CPU
is recommended. Furthermore, you should bind the netsniff-ng tools
to a specific CPU via commandline option (i.e. --bind 0).
