NAME
----
ifpps - kernel networking statistics per sec

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ifpps' device
'ifpps' -d device [-t interval] [-cCHlvh]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
ifpps-ng provides top-like kernel networking statistics per second.

ifpps, like 'interface packets per second', displays Megabyte, packets, drop 
rates and errors that are top-like refreshed per user-defined interval as well 
as the IRQs per CPU. Statistics are coming directly from the kernel, so the 
figures are as accurate as possible and there is no need to run this as root.
