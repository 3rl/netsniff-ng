netsniff-ng (0.5.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Last Debian version was packaged as that was Debian-specific
  * netsniff-ng now in /sbin/
  * Fixed some more bugs within debian folder, including:
    + debian/control: architecture is now any, removed 'conflicts' 
                      and 'recommends', updated 'standarts version'
    + debian/rules: moved dh_* from binary-indep to binary-arch, replaced
                    dh_clean -k with dh_prep
    + debian/watch: added watch file
  * Excluded check_packets from Makefile, moved source into clients/
    because it is just an example application and will not be further 
    supported and developed.
