netsniff-ng (0.5.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New (minor) upstream release with security fix in netsniff-ng.c:
    A memset with a 4 Byte length overhead on 32-Bit systems could 
    run into a possible buffer overflow. Relevant sections have been fixed.
  * debian/control:
    + Changed architecture, because netsniff-ng is not written for 
      non-linux archs as kfreebsd-*
