netsniff-ng (0.5.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New (minor) upstream release with security fix in netsniff-ng.c:
    A memset with a 4 Byte length overhead could run into a possible 
    buffer overflow on 32-Bit systems. Relevant sections have been fixed.
  * Changed architecture in debian/control, because it does not build on 
    non-linux archs
