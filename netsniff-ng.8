.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
netsniff\-ng is is a free (GPL), performant Linux network sniffer for packet inspection\&.
.sp
The gain of performance is reached by \fIzero\-copy\fR mechanisms, so that the kernel does not need to copy packets from kernelspace to userspace\&.
.sp
For this purpose netsniff\-ng is libpcap independent, but nevertheless supports the pcap file format for capturing, replaying and performing offline\-analysis of pcap dumps\&. Furthermore we are focussing on building a robust, clean and secure analyzer and utilities that complete netsniff\-ng as a support for penetration testing\&.
.sp
netsniff\-ng can be used for protocol analysis, reverse engineering and network debugging\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-d <netdev>, \-\-dev <netdev>
.RS 4
<netdev> defines the packet capturing device\&. This can for instance be a typical device like eth0 or wlan0\&. Running netsniff\-ng without a given device parameter, it looks for up and running networking devices and selects the first device that has been found\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p <pcap\-file>, \-\-dump <pcap\-file>
.RS 4
netsniff\-ng stores the captured packets into the given <pcap\-file>\&. It understands the PCAP specification, so that dumps can be read or postprocessed with other tools, too\&. Usually, this option should be combined with \-\-silent and \-\-bind\-cpu to win some performance\&.
.RE
.PP
\-r <pcap\-file>, \-\-replay <pcap\-file>
.RS 4
The given <pcap\-file> will be replayed via a memory mapped kernelspace TX_RING\&. A BPF filter may be combined to only replay parts of the PCAP formatted file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i <pcap\-file>, \-\-read <pcap\-file>
.RS 4
<pcap\-file> will be read in and printed to the console in order to perform an offline analysis\&. Same here: a BPF may be combined to only show relevant parts of the PCAP formatted file\&. Next to this, packet printing that are enabled on the normal mode are supported, too\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f <bpf\-file>, \-\-filter <bpf\-file>
.RS 4
Attaches a Berkeley Packet Filter to the socket in order to pre\-filter traffic within the kernel\&. Example files are given within /etc/netsniff\-ng/rules/\&. The section
\fIBERKELEY PACKET FILTER\fR
describes how to write filter files\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t <pkt\-type>, \-\-type <pkt\-type>
.RS 4
A <pkt\-type> specification allows to post\-filter packets within userspace context (therefore slower than BPF)\&. The following types are supported: host \- only show incoming packets to our host, broadcast \- only show Broadcast packets, multicast \- only show Multicast packets, others \- only show packets from other hosts (promiscuous mode), outgoing \- only show outgoing packets from our host
.RE
.PP
\-b <cpu\-range>, \-\-bind\-cpu <cpu\-range>
.RS 4
Force system scheduler to schedule netsniff\-ng only on specific CPUs\&. Parameters may be
\fI0\fR
for using only CPU0,
\fI0,1\fR
for using CPU0 and CPU1 or even
\fI0\-4\fR
for using a whole CPU range\&. If you have a customized init process that leaves out a special CPU you could bind netsniff\-ng on that free CPU for maximal performance\&. On the other hand, you can avoid scheduling netsniff\-ng on CPUs which are reserved for other critical tasks\&. This can also be combined with taskset(1) in order to reschedule other processes on other CPUs to let netsniff\-ng run on its own CPU\&.
.RE
.PP
\-B <cpu\-range>, \-\-unbind\-cpu <cpu\-range>
.RS 4
Force system scheduler to not schedule netsniff\-ng on specific CPUs\&. The parameter syntax is equivalent to \-b and also the semantics are inverted to \-b\&.
.RE
.PP
\-S <ring\-size>, \-\-ring\-size <size>
.RS 4
This manually sets the desired ring size for RX_RING or TX_RING\&. You should only use this option, if you know what you are doing, because choosing a ring size which is too large for your system, the kernel does neither warn you nor throws an error\&. It simply kills other processes to grab their space\&. The parameter can be defined in KB, MB or GB as
\fI10MB\fR
for a 10 Megabyte ring size\&.
.RE
.PP
\-I, \-\-info
.RS 4
Shows information about available networking devices\&.
.RE
.PP
\-M, \-\-no\-promisc
.RS 4
Forbids the NIC to enter the promiscuous mode\&. The promiscuous mode is activated by default\&. It is a configuration of a network card that makes the card pass all traffic it receives to the central processing unit rather than just frames addressed to it\&. Well, do not ask yourself why you cannot see traffic by others within a switched network\&. Unlike old hubs, switches are some kind of intelligent devices with internal ARP tables for each port in order to reduce traffic load and prevent sniffing other connections\&. If you really intent to sniff others traffic, go read about ARP cache poisoning / MITM\&.
.RE
.PP
\-H, \-\-prio\-norm
.RS 4
This option prevents to automatically high priorize itself\&. Normally, netsniff\-ng will be scheduled with high priority thus it use the full CPU timeslice\&.
.RE
.PP
\-Q, \-\-notouch\-irq
.RS 4
If netsniff\-ng will be bound to a single CPU, say CPU0, then it automatically rebinds the NIC interrupt affinity to that CPU, too for a better performance\&. This feature is intended to be enabled on non\-wireless interfaces\&. notouch\-irq forbids netsniff\-ng to move the IRQ affinity\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n, \-\-non\-block
.RS 4
Lets netsniff\-ng run in non\-blocking mode\&. Generally, you won\(cqt need this feature very often unless there is some interest in performance behaviour analysis\&. This will bypass the ring polling mechanism thus CPU load will most certainly rise to 100 percent\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s, \-\-silent
.RS 4
Does not print packets to the terminal\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q, \-\-less
.RS 4
Prints one\-liner information summary per packet\&.
.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP
\-x, \-\-payload\-hex
.RS 4
Shows only the payload information of the packet in hexadecimal format\&.
.RE
.PP
\-C, \-\-c\-style

Instead of printing packet in usual hex format, a copy\-and\-paste C like format will be printed to the terminal\&.
.RE

.SH "BERKELEY PACKET FILTER"
.sp
The Berkeley Packet Filter or BSD Packet Filter was first introduced in 1993 by Steven McCanne and Van Jacobson at the USENIX\&. Its purpose is to filter packets within the kernel as early as possible, so that only the relevant packets will be brought to the user\-level process\&.
.sp
The Linux kernel has adapted this feature, which nowadays is available in PF_PACKET\&. BPF therefore uses a register\-based filter\-machine that is efficient on todays RISCs\&. Since most applications of a packet filter reject far more packets than they accept and, thus, good performance of the packet filter is critical to good overall performance [1]\&. This should also be kept in mind during development of filters\&.
.sp
If you don\(cqt want to write your own filters, we currently ship some examples within /etc/netsniff\-ng/rules/ that can be used with netsniff\-ngs \-f option\&. Furthermore \fItcpdump \-dd\fR provides filter creation that netsniff\-ng can read, but be warned \- most certainly you might need to edit the return value, which defines the packet snaplen for your needs\&. Read section NOTES for more information about this\&. In future versions netsniff\-ng will also ship its own filter compiler for a simple usage\&.
.sp
If you are an advanced user and if you would like to have full control of what should be filtered and what not, then writing your own filter could be a suitable choice\&. Hence, in the following the language specification will be described in short with given examples on how to use it\&.
.sp
The BPF pseudo\-machine consists of an accumulator, an index register (X), a scratch memory store and an implicit program counter\&. Operations on this machine can be categorized into (all the following refering to [1]):

The opcode field indicates the instruction type and addressing modes\&. The jt and jf fields are used by the conditional jump instructions and are the offsets from the next instruction to the true and false targets\&. The K field is a generic field used for various purposes\&.

The index register cannot use the packet addressing modes\&. Instead, a packet value must be loaded into the accumulator and transferred to the index register, via tax\&.

The first instruction line is a load instruction, because we have LD|H|ABS which results in 0x28\&. So the 16 Bit valued halfword at the packet offset 0xc will be copied into the accumulator\&. This is the Ethernet type field\&. Instruction line 2 belongs to the class JMP, more specific JMP|JEQ and takes the value which is stored in K (0x806, the Ethernet type identifier for ARP)\&. If 0x806 equals the value that has been loaded into the accumulator, the instruction pointer points to the current instruction plus jt value (which is 0) plus 1\&. So we end up at instruction line 3, which is the return opcode as RET|K\&. By using 0xffffffff as K, we tell the kernel that we would like to have a packet snaplen of 0xffffffff, which means that we end up with the complete (\fIuncut\fR) packet\&. 0xffffffff will be replaced by the real packet length if the kernel detects packets less than a length of 0xffffffff\&. Well, on the other hand we would trap into the jf value if we don\(cqt have an ARP packet\&. There, the instruction pointer will point to line 4 where we tell the kernel to drop the packet\&. The length of 0 simply means: Do not hand over the packet to the BPF attached socket\&.

The Linux kernel now takes skb\(->len instead of 0xFFFFFFFF\&. If you do not change it, the kernel will take 0x00000060 as buffer length and packets larger than 96 Byte will be cut off (filled with zero Bytes)!

The TX_RING is part of the kernel since 2\&.6\&.31\&. Needs kind of a compatibility mode for older kernels\&.

Currently, we don\(cqt have a BPF compiler built\-in, so that either the user needs to use filter definitions from /etc/netsniff\-ng/rules, tcpdump \-dd or write his own filter by hand\&.
