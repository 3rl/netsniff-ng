<h3><a name="20">ifpps now with promisc mode support, new tool: trafgen</a></h3>
<i>23/03/2011, Daniel Borkmann, Emmanuel Roullit</i>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>ifpps</b> now also supports promiscuous mode, so under root start it with, i.e. <code>ifpps -d eth0 -p</code> and you're good to go.
</p>
<p>
We proudly announce a new tool within our networking suite. It's called <b>trafgen</b> and it is a powerful 'zero-copy' traffic generator! Here's how you can test trafgen (<i>note:</i> 1. only do this within an isolated test network, 2. trafgen is still experimental!):
</p>
<p>
<pre>
$ git clone git://repo.or.cz/netsniff-ng.git
$ cd src/trafgen
$ make deploy
# ./trafgen --dev eth0 --conf ../trafgen.txf --bind 0
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Here's how the trafgen.txf <i>example configuration</i> file looks like:
<pre>
#
# e.g.: trafgen --dev eth0 --conf &lt;conf-file&gt; --bind 0
#
# This file is an example of a packet configuration file! Packet skeletons 
# can be fetched with netsniff-ng -C (C-like printout).
#
# Payload content can be hexadecimal, decimal, $PRB or $II&lt;n&gt; and is always
# separated with commas:
#
#  $PRB   means random byte
#  $II&lt;n&gt; means counter, there can be several counter specified with &lt;n&gt;, e.g.:
#
#  $II0: 0,255,1
#  $II1: 0x4,0xFF,0x2
#
#  thus counter0 increments from 0 to 255 (and then turns around),
#       counter1 from 0x4 to 0xFF in 0x2 steps.
#
# Packets are defined with:
#  $P&lt;n&gt; {
#    &lt;content&gt;
#  }
#
# If more than 1 packet is defined, packets will be tx'ed in a round robin
# fashion, but you can also push the packets randomly via command line param.
#
# The receiver side can have ifpps running (in promisc mode).
#

$II0: 0,255,1
$II1: 0x4,0xFF,0x2

$P1 {
  $PRB, 0xff, $II0, $II1, $II0, 0xff, 0x00, 0xd0, 0x00, 0x54, 0x9c, 0x00, 0x08, 
  0x06, 0x00, 0x01, 0x08, 0x00, 0x06, 0x04, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0xd0, 0x00, 0x54,

  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
}

$P2 {
  $PRB, 0xff, 0x00, $II1, $II1, 0xff, 0x00, 0xd0, 0x00, 0x54, 0x9c, 0x00, 0x08, 
  0x06, 0x00, 0x01, 0x08, 0x00, 0x06, 0x04, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0xd0, 0x00, 0x54, 
  0x9c, 0x00, 0x52, 0x82, 0x66, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x52, 
  0x82, 0x66, 0x6f, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00

<p>
We are looking forward for lots of testing and patches! So in this sense ... happy packet generation! ;-)

<h3><a name="19">Minor update, nettoolbox-ng library</a></h3>
<i>17/03/2011, Daniel Borkmann, Emmanuel Roullit</i>
<blockquote>
<p>
We've set up a minor stable update to netsniff-ng (see footnote) and furthermore, we've added the nettoolbox-ng library to our homepage. It is a library of networking features and targeted for developers and network hackers and mostly originated from Emmanuels work on multithreaded RX/TX tasks. nettoolbox-ng supports things like:
<ul>
  <li>Zero-Copy RX/TX rings</li>
  <li>Multithreaded RX/TX tasks</li>
  <li>RX/TX compatibility mode</li>
  <li>PCAP support (w/o using libpcap)</li>
  <li>BPF support</li>
  <li>Packet dissection</li>
  <li>Network interface control</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="16">0.5.6.0 branch moved to netsniff-ng.git/master</a></h3>
<i>12/10/2010, Daniel Borkmann</i>
<blockquote>
<p>
Since netsniff-ng 0.5.5.0 has been released, the code tree has been branched from master to <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/netsniff-ng.git/tree/0.5.5.0/">0.5.5.0</a> in order to fix minor bugs and keep up support. We're now working on distribution specific packages. 0.5.5.0 already got into <a href="http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=netsniff-ng">Debian GNU/Linux</a>. Our maintainers are also working on versions for Fedora/RHEL, Mandriva, OpenSUSE, Slackware and others.
</p>
<p>
The netsniff-ng.git/master branch already got the new development code base for 0.5.6.0 which is a complete architectural rewrite on the core of netsniff-ng.

<h3><a name="15">netsniff-ng 0.5.5.0</a></h3>
<i>09/10/2010, Emmanuel Roullit, Daniel Borkmann</i>
<blockquote>
<p>
Well, the clock is running a week behind, but here we go - netsniff-ng 0.5.5.0 is finally out! There lots of changes to the previous 0.5.4.2 version. Here are the most important ones:
<ul>
<li>Support of the PCAP file format which enabled netsniff-ng to dump, read and replay traces to/from harddisk</li>
<li>Lots of new packet printing options targeted for debugging and reverse engineering</li>
<li>Automatic NIC IRQ affinity adaption, if netsniff-ng is bound to a specific CPU</li>
<li>Possibility for manual setup of ring size</li>
<li>POSIX compatible extended regular expression based filtering of packet content</li>
</ul>
Have a look at the <a href="http://www.netsniff-ng.org/doc/netsniff-ng.html">manpage</a> for all the usage details and functionality.

<h3><a name="13">0.5.6.0 first RX mode tests with new dissector</a></h3>
<i>26/09/2010, Daniel Borkmann</i>
<blockquote>
<p>
As you might have noticed, we're rewriting the core of netsniff-ng (<a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/netsniff-ng.git/tree/master">http://repo.or.cz/w/netsniff-ng.git/tree/master</a>) in order to have a better architecture for future netsniff-ng development. The RX-only mode works so far and can be tested. There's still lots of work to cover all of the old functionality, but we're on a good move! As the title mentions we now have a new packet dissector that is far more flexible than the old one. It's based on function call tables and traverses the packet layer by layer. The effort to add a new dissector for a protocol has been reduced to just one header file that has to be added and registered.

<h3><a name="12">First version of ifpps for testing</a></h3>
<i>18/09/2010, Daniel Borkmann</i>
<blockquote>
<p>
From now on, we provide a new networking tool for showing real time RX/TX/IRQ NIC statistics. Our tool is called <b>ifpps</b> like 'interface packets per second'. It displays Megabyte, packets, drop rates and errors that are top-like refreshed per user-defined interval as well as the IRQs per CPU. The good thing is that the statistics are coming <i>directly</i> from the kernel, so the figures are as accurate as possible <i>and</i> you don't need to be root to run this. ifpps needs to have ncurses installed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Here's how you can test it:</b><br>
<pre>
$ git clone git://repo.or.cz/netsniff-ng.git
$ cd netsniff-ng/src/ifpps
$ make
$ ./ifpps eth1
</pre>
</p>

Furthermore, there are also options to export the data as CSV data in order to post-process your records with tools like Gnuplot, Nagios or others. Upcoming netsniff-ng versions will ship ifpps, too.

<h3><a name="9">Moving from GoogleCode to GitHub</a></h3>
<i>01/09/2010, Daniel Borkmann</i>

<p>
Within the next days we're moving our whole source repository and ticket system to GitHub. GoogleCode only provided SVN and Mercurial, but not native <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> support. We believe that Git as a distributed version control system suits most for the development of netsniff-ng. The main repository where you can <i>clone</i> will be at <a href="http://github.com/danborkmann/netsniff-ng/">http://github.com/danborkmann/netsniff-ng/</a>. The GoogleCode page will then become obsolete and will be removed.

During the summer academy about Computer Science held by the German National Merit Foundation in Ftan, there was some time to hack on the netsniff-ng code and to make plans about the upcoming server version of netsniff-ng. Emmanuel and I are planning to integrate a statistical anomaly detection within the future server version of netsniff-ng. A possible mathematical model could be Holt-Winters with triple or quad exponential smoothing and optional Kalman filtering for making predictions more robust. We keep you up to date with this plan.

<h3><a name="7">sysfs or how to make people angry</a></h3>
<i>11/06/2010, Emmanuel Roullit</i>
<blockquote>
<p>
The last couple of days, we did some code review and tests to prepare the 0.5.5.0 for the release.
</p>
<p>
While having a look into <i>lib/netdev.c</i>, (which contains a set of functions to fetch info from network devices) it mainly uses ioctl and sometimes proc with some not so nice string parsing. ioctls and proc interface are said not to be used anymore by any new project which I can understand.
</p>
<p>
After a quick look, it looks like that most info are easily available in the sysfs at <i>/sys/class/net/&lt;device_name&gt;/device/*</i>
</p>
<p>
Ok great, open the right file to get the related info, read its contents and your are set. All gets unified, no more ugly parsing. Sounds like a deal!
</p>
<p>
And after having a look at the sysfs documentation of the Linux kernel, we can find this paragraph:
</p>
<p>
Accessing <i>/sys/class/net/eth0/device</i> is a bug in the application.
</p>
<p>
Wait ... What?! Kernel people, that’s too easy to make a very good interface for userland program and then in just write in the documentation, if you use it, you suck, you should use ioctl and proc instead!
</p>
<p>
We can just hope, it makes like ioctl which are considered as deprecated but are still there.

<h3><a name="5">gource on netsniff-ng</a></h3>
<i>26/05/2010, Emmanuel Roullit</i>
<blockquote>
<p>
Gource is a tool to give a graphic representation of the progress made by a project using SCM.
</p>
<p>
For now, this tool only supports git, mercurial and bazaar.
</p>
<p>
For SVN support, you can use the git to SVN bridge in the packet git-svn and pull your project using:
</p>
<p>
<code>git svn clone https://my.svn.repository</code>
</p>
<p>
It can be long on large projects but eventually it will complete.
</p>
<p>
After pulling Gource from its Github repository at <a href="http://github.com/acaudwell/Gource">http://github.com/acaudwell/Gource</a>, getting the source compiled is only a matter of reading the INSTALL text file, installing missing packets and executing the commands.
</p>
<p>
When the Gource executable is created and your repository is on your local machine, just issue this command to start the animation:
</p>
<p>
<code>./gource path_to_repository/</code>
</p>
<p>
Have a look at its manpage to input the wanted parameters
</p>
<p>
It worked perfectly on netsniff-ng at the first shot. Perfectly useless thus completely indispensable.

<h3><a name="4">libpcaps Berkeley Packet Filter oddities</a></h3>
<i>06/05/2010, Daniel Borkmann</i>
<blockquote>
<p>
Besides the fact that we do <i>not</i> use libpcap, it’s been a while since our shipped filter examples caused some problems. Some of them have been generated with tcpdumps <i>-dd</i> option, some have been written by hand. During our tests it was a bit of a coincidence that we suddenly discovered a packet payload cut - always at the same offset! Digging into our code didn’t really help to solve the problem, so it had to be within the generated filter program (or within the kernel’s filter state machine, but this seems rather unlikely). After looking up the kernel source, we discovered within <i>net/core/filter.c</i>:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
/**
 *	sk_run_filter - run a filter on a socket
 *	@skb: buffer to run the filter on
 *	@filter: filter to apply
 *	@flen: length of filter

 * Decode and apply filter instructions to the skb->data.
 * Return length to keep, 0 for none. skb is the data we are
 * filtering, filter is the array of filter instructions, and
 * len is the number of filter blocks in the array.

	u32 X = 0;			/* Index Register */
	u32 mem[BPF_MEMWORDS];		/* Scratch Memory Store */
	u32 tmp;
	int k;
	int pc;

	/*
	 * Process array of filter instructions.
	 */
 [...]
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
... which gets called from <i>net/packet/af_packet.c</i> at
</p>
<p>
<pre>
static inline unsigned int run_filter(struct sk_buff *skb, struct sock *sk,
				      unsigned int res)

   Note tricky part: we DO mangle shared skb! skb->data, skb->len
   and skb->cb are mangled. It works because (and until) packets
   falling here are owned by current CPU. Output packets are cloned
   by dev_queue_xmit_nit(), input packets are processed by net_bh
   sequencially, so that if we return skb to original state on exit,
   we will not harm anyone.

<p>
Well, things are getting clear now! So we changed all return instructions of our example filters from
<i>0x6, 0, 0, 0x00000060</i> into <i>0x6, 0, 0, 0xFFFFFFFF</i> to get the full packet payload and now
things are working out for us!
</p>
<p>
Later, we saw the comment from libpcaps <i>pcap-linux.c</i>:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
/*
 * XXX: According to the kernel source we should get the real
 * packet len if calling recvfrom with MSG_TRUNC set. It does
 * not seem to work here :(, but it is supported by this code
 * anyway.
 * To be honest the code RELIES on that feature so this is really
 * broken with 2.2.x kernels.
 * I spend a day to figure out what's going on and I found out
 * that the following is happening:
 *
 * The packet comes from a random interface and the packet_rcv
 * hook is called with a clone of the packet. That code inserts
 * the packet into the receive queue of the packet socket.
 * If a filter is attached to that socket that filter is run
 * first - and there lies the problem. The default filter always
 * cuts the packet at the snaplen:
 *
 * # tcpdump -d
 * (000) ret      #68
 *
 * So the packet filter cuts down the packet. The recvfrom call
 * says "hey, it's only 68 bytes, it fits into the buffer" with
 * the result that we don't get the real packet length. This
 * is valid at least until kernel 2.2.17pre6.
 *
 * We currently handle this by making a copy of the filter
 * program, fixing all "ret" instructions with non-zero
 * operands to have an operand of 65535 so that the filter
 * doesn't truncate the packet, and supplying that modified
 * filter to the kernel.

So if filters for netsniff-ng will be generated with tcpdump <i>-dd</i> and later used within netsniff-ng you need to adapt the return instruction as described above, but in the midterm future, we’re planning to ship our own integrated filter compiler.

<h3><a name="3">Changes of structure on the project</a></h3>
<i>04/05/2010, Emmanuel Roullit</i>
<blockquote>
<p>
As we feel more and more that we want/need some functionalities which are are apart from an other. We decided to split the netsniff-ng project in multiple tools of a suite net*-ng.
</p>
<p>
The actual netsniff-ng will have the following role:
<ul>
  <li>Make use of RX and TX ring buffers to receive and send packets from a network interface</li>
  <li>Dump them in a text format on a terminal or in a binary format such as PCAP</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
When the latter will be considered as finished, two other tools will emerge:
<ul>
  <li>netfire-ng will give the user the opportunity to generate packets following the input parameters</li>
  <li>netpoison-ng will be in charge to play around with ARP</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This could lead that some functionalities will be packed in a library or that the different tools will have a common interface to communicate with each other.

<h3><a name="2">New development server</a></h3>
<i>02/05/2010, Daniel Borkmann</i>
<blockquote>
<p>
Yesterday, our new develoment server arrived. It’s a <i>SUN Fire V20z</i> with 64Bit AMD Opterons 244 and two Gigabit ethernet ports (Broadcom NetXtreme BCM5703X chipset) as well as SUNs PCI-X <i>X4444A</i>. From time to time, this machine will be upgraded with up to 16GB RAM and two AMD Opteron 254 to run performance tests with netsniff-ng.
