* trafgen:
  + Allow inter departure time as i.e. exponential, uniform, cauchy, normal,
    pareto, ... distributed
  + Rewrite config parser

* tgsh: trafgen Cisco-like frontend CLI for traffic generator appliances
  + Generates full packets, i.e. with support for
    - VLAN
    - MPLS
    - BPDU
    - IGMP
    - DNS
    - ARP
    - ICMP
    - HTTP
    - SIP
    - IPv4 / IPv6
    - UDP / TCP
    - ...
  + Generates set of packets which are i.e. IMIX, Cisco, Tolly,
    RPR, ... distributed
  + Can be interpreted and transmitted by trafgen
  + Use libcli (http://code.google.com/p/libcli/)

* curvetun:
  + Fix zlib compression
  + Rewrite config parsers
  + Re-read client config on SIGUSR1 (?)
  + curvetun server integration with LDAP as an alternative to the clients
    config file (-> Perl script)
  + Show active sessions, possibility to kill active sessions (?)
  + Automatic client reconnect
  + Make it harder for DPIs to detect

* netsniff-ng:
  + Cleanup code, especially in dissector, print-modes and proto sections
  + Support more protocols
  + Add -n|--num option for capturing a number of packets and then quit

* arppoison:
  + ARP Cache Poisoning utility as completion with netsniff-ng

* ashunt:
  + Add IPv6 functionality
  + Fix aslookup parser
  + Add possibility to include user-defined payload to test DPIs

* ifpps:
  + Fix NaN's in CPU usage
  + Cleanup redundant code
  + Add more gnuplot features, i.e. automatic gnuplot script generation

* flowtop:
  + a top-like netfilter connection tracking tool

* t: tests, tests, tests / c: Coccinelle
  + Highly needed!
  + Use Sharness as a framework for tests (https://github.com/misfire/Sharness)
  + Use SmPL / Coccinelle as a framework for 'code error checking'

* Documentation:
  + Manpages
  + Howtos as REAME.<tool>
