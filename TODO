Some future ToDos
=================

Probably this will remain deprecated here, so check out 
http://www.netsniff-ng.org/ or write an email to 
<daniel@netsniff-ng.org> in order to grab some information.

Both tools are long term TODOs:

netpoison-ng:
	Utility for ARP cache poisoning for Man-In-The-Middle sniffing.
netfire-ng:
	High performance replay of PCAP traces.
