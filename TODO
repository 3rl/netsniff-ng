Some future ToDos
=================

Probably this will remain deprecated here, so check out 
http://www.netsniff-ng.org/ or write an email to 
<workgroup@netsniff-ng.org> in order to grab some information.

* Clean rework of netsniff-ng's packet processing machine
* Adding tons of protocols to decode (and may be DPI?)
* Improvements in TX_RING/sendto PCAP replay code
* PCAPng support
* Sysdaemon that provides network statistics for user clients (e.g. Nagios)

Both tools are long term ToDos:

netpoison-ng:
	Utility for ARP cache poisoning for Man-In-The-Middle sniffing.
netfire-ng:
	High performance replay of PCAP traces (low level, kernel-based).
