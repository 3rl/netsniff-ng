Some future ToDos
=================

 * (Still) better visualization of packets during debug-output
 * Colorize debug output, according to Proto and checksum 
   (e.g. bogus packets) - per option
 * Data capturing & replay (TX_RING) in pcap file format
 * Switch to longopts (spport of both)
 * BPF filter code generation
 * Plugin framework (for specialized packet payload output)
 * OS fingerprinting detection (?)
 * Deep Packet Inspection
 * Some more device statistics for wireless net devices
 * Evaluate Packet timestamps --> in ns?
