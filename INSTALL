Requirements (for your own kernels)
===================================

Your kernel should have been built with CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP=y 
in order to use netsniff-ng. This is default on your 
preinstalled Debian kernel. We recommend >= 2.6.26.

Hashsums
========
HASHSUMS is signed with: 0x59B7082F (danborkmann@googlemail.com)

With the tiny gensums script you can generate another file 
and diff it against the provided HASHSUMS to check for 
corruption.

Installation
============

$ make
# make install

Uninstall
=========

# make uninstall
$ make clean
