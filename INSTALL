Currently only operating systems running on Linux kernels with
CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP enabled. This feature can be found even back
to the days of 2.4 kernels. Most operating systems ship pre-compiled
kernels that have this config option enabled and even the latest
kernel versions got rid of this option and have this functionality
already built-in. However, we recommend a kernel >= 2.6.31, because
the TX_RING is officially integrated since then.

netsniff-ng has been sucessfully tested on x86 and x86_64. Please drop
us a short mail, if it runs sucessfully on hardware other than that.

What libraries are required? You'll need libc, libncurses (only for ifpps) 
and libgcrypt (only for curvetun), nothing else. It is common, that these
libraries are shipped as distribution packages for an easy installation.

If you have arch x86 or x86_64, you can add -DARCH_X86 to the Makefiles
CFLAGS in order to exploit some x86-based CPU features (MMX/SSE*).

The installation process is fairly simple:

  $ cd netsniff-ng/src/<tool>/
  $ make deploy
  # make install

 where <tool> := { netsniff-ng, ifpps, trafgen, curvetun }

Note that by only typing 'make' the binaries are built without optimiztion
(-O0), so for productive usage, always build with 'make deploy'!

The uninstallation process is analogous:

  $ cd netsniff-ng/src/<tool>/
  # make uninstall
  $ make clean
