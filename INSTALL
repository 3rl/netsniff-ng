Currently only operating systems running on Linux kernels with
CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP enabled. This feature can be found even back
to the days of 2.4 kernels. Most operating systems ship pre-compiled
kernels that have this config option enabled and even the latest
kernel versions got rid of this option and have this functionality
already built-in. However, we recommend a kernel >= 2.6.31, because
the TX_RING is officially integrated since then.

netsniff-ng has been sucessfully tested on x86 and x86_64. Please drop
us a short mail, if it runs sucessfully on hardware other than that.

What libraries are required? You'll need libc, libncurses (only for ifpps),
and zlib, nothing else. It is common, that these libraries are shipped as
distribution packages for an easy installation.

If you have arch x86 or x86_64, you can add -DARCH_X86 to the Makefiles
CFLAGS in order to exploit some x86-based CPU features (MMX/SSE*).

Also, you might want to adapt the IO Vector size in src/sg_pcap.c
(IOVSIZ) and in src/mmap_pcap.c (map_size) if you don't have enough RAM.

The installation process is fairly simple:

  $ cd netsniff-ng/src/<tool>/
  $ make
  # make install

 where <tool> := { netsniff-ng, ifpps, trafgen, curvetun }

The uninstallation process is analogous:

  $ cd netsniff-ng/src/<tool>/
  # make uninstall
