Requirements (for your own kernels)
===================================

Your kernel should have been built with CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP=y in order 
to use netsniff-ng. This is default on your preinstalled Debian kernel.

Installation
============

$ make
# make install

You will find the following stuff on your box:

/usr/bin/netsniff-ng      - Main program, the 'sniffer'
/usr/bin/check_packets    - Unix domain socket client for netsniff-ng (e.g. for usage with Nagios)
/etc/netsniff-ng/rules/   - Some example Berkeley Packet Filter programs

Uninstall
=========

# make uninstall
$ make clean
