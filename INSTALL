Requirements (for your own kernels)
===================================

Your kernel should have been built with CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP=y in order to use 
netsniff-ng. This is default on your preinstalled Debian kernel. We 
recommend >= 2.6.26.

Hashsums
========
HASHSUMS is signed with: 0x59B7082F (danborkmann@googlemail.com)

With 'gensums' you can generate another HASHSUMS file and diff it against the 
provided HASHSUMS to check for possible corruption.

Installation
============

$ make
# make install

Uninstall
=========

# make uninstall
$ make clean
