What platforms are supported?
=============================

Currently only operating systems running on Linux kernels with
CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP enabled. This feature can be found even back
to the days of 2.4 kernels. Most operating systems ship pre-compiled
kernels that have this config option enabled and even the latest
kernel versions got rid of this option and have this functionality
built-in. However, we recommend >= 2.6.26. 

netsniff-ng has been sucessfully tested on x86 and x86_64. Please drop
us a short mail, if it runs on hardware other than that.

What libraries are required?
============================

 * libc
 * libncurses

Installation
