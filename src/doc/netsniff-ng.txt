netsniff-ng is a high performance Linux network sniffer 
for packet inspection. It can be used for protocol analysis 
and reverse engineering, network debugging, measurement of 
performance throughput or network statistics creation of 
incoming packets.
It works similar to tcpdump, but a 'zero-copy' mechanism 
for network packets results in better performance than 
libpcap-based sniffers.
